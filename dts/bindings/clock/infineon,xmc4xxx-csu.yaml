  Infineon XMC4xxx Clock Select Unit (CSU) is part of the System Control
  Unit (SCU).

  To specify the clocks in a peripheral, the standard clocks property needs
  to be used, e.g.:

    usic0ch0: usic@xxx {
        ...
        /* cell encodes the clock id */
        clocks = <&cctl XMC4XXX_CLOCK_USIC>;
        ...
    }

compatible: "infineon,xmc4xxx-csu"

include: [base.yaml, clock-controller.yaml, pinctrl-device.yaml]

  "#clock-cells":
    const: 1

      - "f_usbpll"

  fext-clk-divider:
    type: int
    description:
